# ROS_PublisherandSubscriber

#### Running a publisher node and a subscriber node.

**The talker.py is the talker node which publishes a string message "Hello world" to a topic called "chatter"**


**The listener.py is the listener node that receives (hears) the publisher node topic (in this case a string message "Hello world")**
